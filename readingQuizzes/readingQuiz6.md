Reading Quiz 6
==================

1. **Describe how the Q and Q' outputs of an RS latch retain information.**

 By having Q and Q' feed into opposing Nor gates.
2. **Explain why a DFF's output is equal to what it's input was one unit of time ago (why does out(t) = in(t-1)?). Hint: can you think of an illustrative metaphor?**

 Bacause the current output feeds back as the input in the next time step. (not sure of any metaphor)
3. **What does it mean for a flip-flop to be level-triggered?**

 Level-triggered means that the flip-flop saves the value of the Data input when the Hold That Bit input is at a particular level.
4. **What does it mean for a flip-flop to be edge-triggered?**

An edge trigger causes the outputs to change only when the Clock makes a transition from 0 to 1.

5. **How does a frequency divider get its name?**

 Because the frequency of the Q output is half that of the oscillator.
