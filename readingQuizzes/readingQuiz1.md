Reading Quiz 1
=================

1. **When communicating with a flashlight, why isn't it practical to just 'write' the letters in the air or use a sequential series of blinks (A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, etc) ? (I'm looking for two specific words.)**

  When communicating with a flashlight, it's not practical to wave it around because the motions made are not precise enough to be understood accurately as letters. When using a sequence of blinks, the problem becomes the fact that since there is only one basic unit with numbers of that basic unit which makes up letters and so on, it takes a long time and a lot of blinks to communicate anything meaningful.

2. **Explain how speech itself (the English vocabulary) is a code (what do words represent?).**

 Speech itself is a code because the words represent either concrete things or ideas in the world.

3. **What makes certain codes "useful?" (I'm looking for a specific quote from the text.)**

 >"A code is useful if it serves a purpose that no other code can."

4. **How is Morse code itself a 'meta' code?**

 Morse code is itself a 'meta' code because the dots and dashes that we use to represent it isn't actually what is being sent, but rather, electrical signals corresponding to those dots and dashes are or in the example from the book, blinks of light.

5. **The book says that Braille is binary. Do you agree? Explain why or why not.**

 Braille, at it's very basic is binary since a spot can be either raised or flat, one of 2 positions. However, because of the existence of shift codes in grade 2 braille, the same symbol can represent multiple things based on the symbol that precedes it. Nevertheless, since at it's most basic, there are only 2 positions a piece of paper can be in, it can be considered to be binary.
